		<p>Even with a contract, it is inevitable one of our clients is going to ask for revisions that were not within the bounds of our original agreement. We can be flexible about these changes, but you don’t have to make them for free.</p>
		<p>We spend weeks working on a website, agonizing over every detail and producing something that we can’t wait to show your client. We’re sure the client will be just as overjoyed as you are about the final look. You click “send,” and you wait for the accolades to start pouring in.</p>
		<p>Generally, I make every effort to provide them with the solution they are looking for, but there are times when I will tell a client, ‘That can’t be done well,’ and I’ll explain why, or I’ll say, ‘Yes, that can be done, but it’s going to push the completion of the project way back</p>

		<h4>Disadvantage</h4>
		<h5>1. Bad Search</h5>
		<p>Overly literal search engines reduce usability in that they're unable to handle typos, plurals, hyphens, and other variants of the query terms. Such search engines are particularly difficult for elderly users, but they hurt everybody.</p>
		<p>A related problem is when search engines prioritize results purely on the basis of how many query terms they contain, rather than on each document's importance. Much better if your search engine calls out "best bets" at the top of the list — especially for important queries, such as the names of your products.</p>
		<h5>2. PDF Files for Online Reading</h5>
		<p>Users hate coming across a PDF file while browsing, because it breaks their flow. Even simple things like printing or saving documents are difficult because standard browser commands don't work. Layouts are often optimized for a sheet of paper, which rarely matches the size of the user's browser window. Bye-bye smooth scrolling. Hello tiny fonts.</p>
		<h5>3. Not Changing the Color of Visited Links</h5>
		<p>A good grasp of past navigation helps you understand your current location, since it's the culmination of your journey. Knowing your past and present locations in turn makes it easier to decide where to go next. Links are a key factor in this navigation process. Users can exclude links that proved fruitless in their earlier visits. Conversely, they might revisit links they found helpful in the past.</p>
		<h5>4. Non-Scannable Text</h5>
		<p> A wall of text is deadly for an interactive experience. Intimidating. Boring. Painful to read.
		Write for online, not print. To draw users into the text and support scannability, use well-documented tricks:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>subheads</li>
			<li>bulleted lists</li>
			<li>highlighted keywords</li>
			<li>short paragraphs</li>
			<li>the inverted pyramid</li>
			<li>a simple writing style, and</li>
			<li>de-fluffed language devoid of marketese.</li>
		</ul>
		<h5>5. Fixed Font Size</h5>
		<p>CSS style sheets unfortunately give websites the power to disable a Web browser's "change font size" button and specify a fixed font size. About 95% of the time, this fixed size is tiny , reducing readability significantly for most people over the age of 40.</p>
		<h5>6. Page Titles With Low Search Engine Visibility</h5>
		<p>Search is the most important way users discover websites. Search is also one of the most important ways users find their way around individual websites. The humble page title is your main tool to attract new visitors from search listings and to help your existing users to locate the specific pages that they need.</p>
		<h5>7. Anything That Looks Like an Advertisement</h5>
		<p>Selective attention is very powerful, and Web users have learned to stop paying attention to any ads that get in the way of their goal-driven navigation. (The main exception being text-only search-engine ads.). Therefore, it is best to avoid any designs that look like advertisements. The exact implications of this guideline will vary with new forms of ads; currently follow these rules:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>banner blindness</li>
			<li>animation avoidance</li>
			<li>pop-up purges</li>
		</ul>
		<h5>8. Violating Design Conventions</h5>
		<p>Consistency is one of the most powerful usability principles: when things always behave the same, users don't have to worry about what will happen. Instead, they know what will happen based on earlier experience. Every time you release an apple over Sir Isaac Newton, it will drop on his head. That's good.</p>
		<h5>9. Opening New Browser Windows</h5>
		<p>Opening up new browser windows is like a vacuum cleaner sales person who starts a visit by emptying an ash tray on the customer's carpet. Don't pollute my screen with any more windows, thanks (particularly since current operating systems have miserable window management).</p>
		<h5> 10. Not Answering Users' Questions</h5>
		<p>Users are highly goal-driven on the Web. They visit sites because there's something they want to accomplish — maybe even buy your product. The ultimate failure of a website is to fail to provide the information users are looking for.</p>
